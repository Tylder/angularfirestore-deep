the it in order to reduce reads.\nIt becomes a balance between speed and economy. Since multiple docs can be read simultaneously but will cost more.\nThese classes aim to make it easy to control that.\nAllows you to have a complex deep object and write it to firestore by splitting it up in to collections and documents.\nExample services object that we wish to save to firestore.\nconst services = {\n   name: 'example services',\n   address: {\n      zipcode: 12345,\n      city: 'example city',\n      line1: '12 example rd'\n   },\n   dishes: [\n     {\n       name: 'dish1',\n       images: [\n         {url: example.jpg},\n         {url: example2.jpg}\n       ]\n     },\n     {\n       name: 'dish2',\n       images: [\n         {url: example.jpg},\n         {url: example2.jpg}\n       ]\n     }\n   ]\n   reviews: [\n     {\n        score: 5\n        text: 'decent food'\n     },\n     {\n        score: 8\n        text: 'good food'\n     },\n   ]\n}  You would be able to save this data 'as is' to a single firestore document using arrays and maps.\n  The problem comes when you later on wish to add/delete or alter an image of dish.\n  Another issue is that you might have thousands of reviews and since they are all saved in the same document.\n  If for example you wish to show a list of all restaurants and all you want to show is the name before a user clicks\n  the services you would still have to download the entire services object containing all those thousands of reviews.\n  This would be ok in terms of cost of reads but very expensive in terms of performance.\n  Each services object would be huge, killing the user's data plan and slowing down your site.\n  It would be much better to make reviews a collection inside services. That way you could show the services name\n  without downloading all the reviews.\n  If you wish to show an average review score the most efficient way would be to to calculate that\n  each time you update the review collection and adding the average to the services document.\n  What this wrapper intends to do is to simplify saving some data in sub collections without changing the way you\n  work with the data.\n  So you could have a services object that contains all the data and when you add it to firestore the data is automatically\n  placed in your sub collections without you having to worry about it after you initially set it up.\n  Another huge advantage to separating your data in to sub collections is that it allows you to choose between\n  performance and cost.\n  Saving the data to one large document would save your firestore read/writes and could potentially make a big difference\n  in terms of cost depending on your application.\n  But it would also slow it down as explained above.\n  Splitting your data up in to sub collections allows you to asyncronously read/write those collections at the same time.\n  So if you compare one large document and a small document with 4 subcollections of about equal size.\n  It would require 5 firestore reads instead of 1 if each sub collection contains 1 document.\n  But the speed could also potentially be 5X faster since all those parts are read at the same time.\n  Using SubCollectionWriters and SubCollectionQueries allows you to create the perfect compromise between\n  ease of working with the firestore database, cost and performance.\n\naddress (collection)\nreviews (collection)\ndishes (collection)\nimages (collection)\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n            \n                Example\n            \n

great benefits from Firebase Firestore.\nnpm install --save @angularfirestore-deepFirestore splits its data up into collections and documents which is what allows it to be scalable and fast.\nThe issues that this can cause is that the best way to store your data might not be the best way to work with and display that data.\nIt can also be more difficult to figure out how to store your data in a way that is not only cheap in terms of reads but also cheap in terms of performance/speed.\nAngularFireStore-Deep is meant to help developers solve these issues.\nDocumentation and Examples\nDocumentation\nIt is as simple as:\nDemo\nDemo\nor \nnpm run start to run a local demo\nUsing the library\nImport the library in any Angular application by running:\n$ npm install ngx-long-click --saveand then from your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import the library module\nimport {NgxLongClickModule} from 'ngx-long-click';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify NgxLongClickModule library as an import\n    NgxLongClickModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once your library is imported, you can

Since all the data is stored under the same document.\nWe can get the base restaurant data for displaying in a list without getting unnecessary data.\n\n\nIssues: \nWhen the user presses the restaurant we want to get all the data, that means writing code to get the reviews and the dishes and then putting them all together again to create\nthe restaurant object as seen in the example. This gets even worse if you decide to place the images or other data in its own collection under each dish document.\nWe end up doing a lot of collecting of all the data from different places and putting it back together for use in our app.\nThe same is true if we start of with a restaurant object and with to save it to firestore, we then have to split it up and save each part separetly.       \n\n\n\n\nWe could store them together will all other reviews in a top level collection, each review would be its own document.\n\nBenefits: \nKeeps all reviews together and makes it simpler to perform complicated queries on them. \nFor example maybe you with to display all reviews from a specific user. \nHowever you could still do this with a sub collection using firestore.collectionGroup.\nWe can get the base restaurant data for displaying in a list without getting unnecessary data.\n\n\nIssues: \nWould require a costly, but fast query for restaurant name in order to get the reviews related to a specific restaurant.\nSame as above.\n\n\n\n\n\nI think that in this case since its much more common to want the reviews per restaurant rather than per user, we should keep the reviews in a sub collection under the product.\nThis would make getting the restaurants reviews cheaper and faster.\nWouldn't it be nice to not have to worry about splitting the data up into sub collections and putting it back together again when you \nwant the entire object.\nThat is where AngularFirestore-deep comes in.\nThe 'deep' comes from the ability to read/write/update/delete collections and documents arbitrarily deep (up to the firestore max of 100 levels) and not have to worry about splitting the data up and putting it back together.\nWe do that by using SubCollectionQueries and SubCollectionWriters, these are classes that allow us to specify how we want the data to be stored. \nAngularFirestore-deep then uses these to perform your read/write/update/delete and you do not have to deal with splitting up the data and collecting it back together.\n\nExample SubCollectionQuery array\nThis SubCollectionQuery specifies that the reviews are saved in a collection inside the restaurant document and they should be read and ordered by score.\nThe dishes are also stored as a sub collection and inside each dish document there is another sub collection called images. \nSubCollectionQuery documentation\nconst restaurantSubColQuery: SubCollectionQuery[] = [\n    { \n        name: 'reviews', \n        queryFn: ref => ref.orderBy('score')\n    },\n    {\n        name: 'dishes',\n        subCollectionQueries: [  // sub collection inside a sub collection\n            { \n                name: 'images' \n            }\n        ]\n    },\n];\nExample SubCollectionWriter array\nSubCollectionWriters are very similar to SubCollectionQueries, the most obvious difference is the lack of the need for queryFunctions.\nSubCollectionWriter documentation\nconst restaurantSubColWriters: SubCollectionWriter[] = [\n    { \n        name: 'reviews' \n    },\n    {\n        name: 'dishes',\n        subCollectionWriters: [  // sub collection inside a sub collection\n            { \n                name: 'images' \n            }\n        ]\n    },\n];Performance / Cost\nAnother huge advantage to separating your data in sub collections is that it allows you to choose between\nperformance and cost.\nSaving the data to one large document would save your firestore read/writes and could potentially make a big difference\nin terms of cost depending on your application.\nBut it would also slow it down as explained above.\nSplitting your data up in to sub collections allows you to asynchronously read/write those collections at the same time.\nSo if you compare one large document and a small document with 4 sub collections of about equal size.\nIt would require 5 firestore reads instead of 1 if each sub collection contains 1 document.\nBut the speed could also potentially be 5X faster since all those collections/documents are read at the same time.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/actions.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/actions.html","title":"additional-page -
